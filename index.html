                <p>My name is Lucero Rivas, I am 25 years old and I live in Thornton, CO. I am currently employed for a small company called VSI Parylene
                in Broomfield, CO. Ive been working here since I graduated from Skyview Academy High School. Its a very interesting type of job and
                I've come to love and enjoy it.  We work alot with new technology components that very in different 
                shapes and sizes,medical devices and military as well. But I feel like I'm ready for something new and challenging. This is the first website Ive ever had to start from scratch. 
                Learning web development and coding has always been a dream of mine and here I am finally doing it. It has been very challening to say the least
                but I have been learning so much in such little time. Besides the fact we tend to be our own worst enemies, I strive for success and I will finish strong.

            <p> So far what I've worked on during this bootcamp was refactoring the code on a website. I just had to make the code easier to read and
                not repeat so much. Here you can find a link to my <a href="https://github.com/Lucero1027/RefactoredWebsite">Github repository</a> were I 
                uploaded my repositroy and here will be a link for the <a href="https://lucero1027.github.io/RefactoredWebsite/">live website.</a>

                I finished my First Project last week. I was in a team with three other people and we created an app from scratch. It's basically just
                an app that lets you choose whichever city you'd like to go and have a beer at and we called it Belly-Buster.Here you can find a link to my 
                <a href="https://github.com/Lucero1027/Belly-Buster">Github repository</a> where you can find our JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Also you can find
                all the merging and git commits we had to practice. Creating this app we were required to make API requests and make sure we could connect both of them
                together to create this app. Here you can find the <a href= https://lucero1027.github.io/Belly-Buster/>live site.</a>
